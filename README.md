🔐 Password Security Analysis & Hash Attack Simulator

A full-stack cybersecurity web application designed to analyze password strength, estimate crack time, and simulate hash-based attack concepts through interactive visualizations.
This project demonstrates practical implementation of password security principles and provides an educational platform for understanding how weak passwords can be compromised.


📌 Project Overview

Password security remains one of the most critical aspects of modern cybersecurity. Many users underestimate how quickly weak passwords can be cracked using brute-force or dictionary-based attacks.


This application was developed to:

Analyze password strength
Measure entropy and complexity
Estimate realistic crack time
Demonstrate how hashing algorithms work
Simulate attack scenarios for educational purposes
Provide visual insights through dynamic charts
The system focuses on clarity, usability, and practical learning.

🚀 Key Features

🔎 Password Strength Analysis
Detects character diversity (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols)
Evaluates complexity level
Provides security rating
Gives improvement suggestions

📊 Entropy Evaluation
Measures password randomness
Classifies security level (Very Weak → Very Strong)
Provides instant feedback to users

⏳ Crack Time Estimation
Estimates how long it would take to brute-force the password
Helps users understand real-world risk

🔐 Hash Generation
Supports multiple hashing algorithms:
MD5
SHA1
SHA256
SHA512

Users can:
Generate secure hashes
Compare algorithm outputs
Understand differences between weak and strong hashing methods
